# React lite

A simple implementation of react.

The package is still under development, and only supports a few react features.

## What's been included

- Pure function component
- Class component (supports setState, no lifecycle method support)
- ReactDOM support (dom update is not fully optimized)
- Bind component event to native dom event

## Next

Implement fully optimized dom update
