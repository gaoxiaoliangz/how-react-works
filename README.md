## Why creating this repo

I want to understand how react works, the best way to do it is to implement it my own way.

The package is at very early stages of development, so only a handful of react features are supported.

## What's been included

- Pure function component
- Class component (supports setState, no lifecycle method support)
- ReactDOM support (dom update is not fully optimized)
- Bind component event to native dom event

## Next

Implement fully optimized dom update
